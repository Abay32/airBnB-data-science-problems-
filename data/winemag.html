 and round, this offers plenty of concentrated blackberry notes 
enveloped in warm spices and supple oak. There's a hint of green tomato 
leaves throughout, but the lush fruit combined with sturdy grape tannins
 and high acidity would pair well with fatty short ribs or braised pork.</td><td>Estate Club</td><td>87</td><td>32</td><td>Virginia</td><td>Virginia</td><td></td><td>Merlot</td><td>Veramar</td></tr><tr class=""><td>127077</td><td>Italy</td><td>This
 luminous sparkler offers measured aromas of yellow fruit and honey and 
delivers a broad, wide approach in the mouth. The wine's texture is 
creamy and full and there is a spicy point of effervescence on the 
palate.</td><td>Extra Dry</td><td>85</td><td>19</td><td>Veneto</td><td>Prosecco di Valdobbiadene</td><td></td><td>Prosecco</td><td>Varaschin</td></tr><tr class=""><td>143029</td><td>US</td><td>There
 are some pretty features to this wine, namely the lovely tannins and 
rich fruit, but it's just too soft and sweet. Tastes like blackberry 
jam, with extra white sugar spinkled on top.</td><td>Signature</td><td>83</td><td>45</td><td>California</td><td>Paso Robles</td><td>Central Coast</td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Byington</td></tr><tr class=""><td>98813</td><td>US</td><td>Lovely
 nose, which runs from violets and cherries right into coffee and sweet 
chocolate. In the mouth the wine coats the palate with Napa-like 
intensity, only buttressed with more vivid acidity. It's both smooth and
 deep. The aromas are more detailed, interesting and really clean, 
loaded with dark flavors of soy, coffee, molasses and black cherry 
liqueur.</td><td>Champoux &amp; Loess Vineyards Reserve</td><td>93</td><td>100</td><td>Washington</td><td>Washington</td><td>Washington Other</td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Boudreaux Cellars</td></tr><tr class=""><td>43172</td><td>US</td><td>Tastes
 sweeter and fruitier than the 2009, which was dry, so if you like 
orange marmalade, pineapple tart and vanilla cookie sugariness in your 
Sauvignon Blancs, it's for you.</td><td>Les Pionniers</td><td>86</td><td>40</td><td>California</td><td>Sonoma County</td><td>Sonoma</td><td>Sauvignon Blanc</td><td>Capture</td></tr><tr class=""><td>14959</td><td>France</td><td>The
 Jaume family's nÌ©gociant business is thriving because of wines like 
this that faithfully represent their terroirs while offering solid 
value. This raspberry- and garrigue-scented wine features ample weight 
framed by supple tannins that firm up on the finish. Drink nowÛÒ2018.</td><td>Les Valats</td><td>89</td><td>27</td><td>RhÌ«ne Valley</td><td>Rasteau</td><td></td><td>RhÌ«ne-style Red Blend</td><td>Alain Jaume et Fils</td></tr><tr class=""><td>11285</td><td>Austria</td><td>Beautifully
 pure apple fruit plays on nose and palate. Citrus juice frames the 
fruit and heightens the freshness even more. If you like a slender, 
supercrisp style of Riesling, the purity of this will have you hooked.</td><td></td><td>93</td><td>20</td><td>Kamptal</td><td></td><td></td><td>Riesling</td><td>Schloss Gobelsburg</td></tr><tr class=""><td>115487</td><td>US</td><td>This
 was a very good vintage for Goldeneye, the best since '01. The fruit 
got ripe, offering up a big mouthful of jammy cherry and raspberry 
flavors accented with sweet oak. The tannin-acid balance is just great. 
It's delicious, yet has all kinds of complex edges and nuances.</td><td></td><td>93</td><td>52</td><td>California</td><td>Anderson Valley</td><td>Mendocino/Lake Counties</td><td>Pinot Noir</td><td>Goldeneye</td></tr><tr class=""><td>77153</td><td>US</td><td>Shows
 classic varietal flavors of cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper, with a
 sweet edge of smoky oak. Enjoyable now for its forward fruit and silky 
texture.</td><td></td><td>86</td><td>17</td><td>California</td><td>California</td><td>California Other</td><td>Pinot Noir</td><td>Donovan-Parke</td></tr><tr class=""><td>131535</td><td>US</td><td>A
 very nice, casual Merlot that has layers of complex elegance beyond 
just the fruit. And what fruit it is, ripe and sweet in cherry pie, 
raspberry cream, cola and vanilla, with a splash of cassis. Fortunately,
 there's enough acidity and tannin for balance.</td><td>Crimson Creek</td><td>88</td><td>27</td><td>California</td><td>Napa Valley</td><td>Napa</td><td>Merlot</td><td>Pine Ridge</td></tr><tr class=""><td>89695</td><td>Argentina</td><td>Opens
 with hard, rubbery, leathery aromas. In the mouth, it's thick and chewy
 with black fruit but also an herbal edge. There's depth and plenty of 
oak here, and it finishes sweet and relatively smooth. Starts rough, 
improves in the middle, and then finishes fairly well.</td><td>Trumpeter</td><td>86</td><td>12</td><td>Mendoza Province</td><td>Mendoza</td><td></td><td>Malbec-Syrah</td><td>Rutini</td></tr><tr class=""><td>44672</td><td>US</td><td>A

 wonderful auslese offers volume and richness without weightÛÓit's a 
sort of fluffy custard in texture, loaded with funky, leesy notes on the
 nose but also with passion fruit, green apple and pineapple notes on 
the palate. Yes, it's sweet, but the acids provide beautiful balance on

 modest cherry, dark berry and black tea notes of this light wine show

 its thick density and slightly off-dry flavors of raisin, cassis, honey
 and liquid smoke, this would pair with hearty country pÌ¢tÌ© or meat 
terrines. Its alcohol, mild tannins and fresh-fruit finish would also 
work with those fatty foods.</td><td>Zane</td><td>88</td><td>22</td><td>Veneto</td><td>Valpolicella Classico Superiore Ripasso</td><td></td><td>Corvina, Rondinella, Molinara</td><td>Carlo Boscaini</td></tr><tr class=""><td>8670</td><td>Turkey</td><td>A
 nose of strawberry and mint with a whiff of petrol sets the scene for 
flavors of cassis, cherry preserves, peach and eucalyptus that never

 peach at the finish.</td><td></td><td>86</td><td>15</td><td>Turkey</td><td></td><td></td><td>Kuntra</td><td>ÌàamlibaÙ</td></tr><tr class=""><td>146870</td><td>South Africa</td><td>A
 fairly big wine, with big tannins and high acidity, that lets its

lemon and mineral. A bit tart on the finish, but with food this is 
enjoyable for its swagger.</td><td></td><td>87</td><td>20</td><td>South Africa</td><td></td><td></td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>The Berrio</td></tr><tr class=""><td>59388</td><td>New Zealand</td><td>This
 attractively priced Pinot Noir combines fruit from Nelson and

fruit. Some slightly briary-herbal notes and silky tannins add interest,
 smoothed out by hints of brown sugar and baking spices. Drink

 refreshing ChardonnayÛÓwith aromas of grapefruit and lemon and flavors

 it balance. Overall, the wine finds a great middle ground and is food 
friendly.</td><td></td><td>84</td><td>8</td><td>Bulgaria</td><td></td><td></td><td>Chardonnay</td><td>Targovishte</td></tr><tr class=""><td>116551</td><td>US</td><td>Tasted
 in October, 2007, the wine was mute, offering little aromatically 
except for teasing notes of blackberries and oak. That shyness extended 
to the taste, where strong, hard tannins provide an almost impenetrable 
coat of armor to what's inside. But right down the middle of the palate 
is a deep, intensely powerful stream of perfectly ripened cassis that's 
all the proof you need of ageability. This is a magnificently structured
 young wine, reminiscent of a fine young Pauillac. Best after 2012, and 
should have another decade after that, at least.</td><td>Insignia</td><td>97</td><td>200</td><td>California</td><td>Napa Valley</td><td>Napa</td><td>Bordeaux-style Red Blend</td><td>Joseph Phelps</td></tr><tr class=""><td>116564</td><td>US</td><td>It's
 impossible for a Cabernet to be richer, more opulent or more 
hedonistically stunning on opening than this beauty from veteran Phelps.
 Admittedly, there are significant tannins. But the wine delivers a 
broadside of the sweetest, ripest cassis fruit imaginable, along with 
richly toasted oak. It's the kind of Cab that will dazzle even an 
amateur. Absolutely gorgeous now, with immaculate elegance. About the 
only criticism you can offer is that the structure is a bit obvious, and
 ageability may be limited.</td><td>Backus</td><td>95</td><td>200</td><td>California</td><td>Oakville</td><td>Napa</td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Joseph Phelps</td></tr><tr class=""><td>74057</td><td>US</td><td>The
 former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself
 among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards 
on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines 
intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, 
crÌ¬me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the
 midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a 
tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines 
that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not
 one to hold much beyond six years.</td><td>Family Reserve</td><td>97</td><td>625</td><td>California</td><td>Napa Valley</td><td>Napa</td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Yao Ming</td></tr><tr class=""><td>83298</td><td>US</td><td>Made
 in the Lokoya style, which is darkly colored, full bodied, tannic and 
dense in mountain fruit. A spicy oak tone joins with massive blackberry,
 cassis and violet flavors to make this wine delicious from the start. 
It's very tannic and needs a great deal of time. Begin to enjoy this 
wine in 2016, and it should go far longer than that.</td><td></td><td>94</td><td>350</td><td>California</td><td>Diamond Mountain District</td><td>Napa</td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Lokoya</td></tr><tr class=""><td>135895</td><td>US</td><td>A
 disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to 
the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the 
alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes 
came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet.</td><td></td><td>84</td><td>225</td><td>California</td><td>Napa Valley</td><td>Napa</td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Meteor</td></tr><tr class=""><td>118377</td><td>Argentina</td><td>Granular,
 raisiny and heavy on the nose, with jammy blackberry aromas. The palate
 then hits with a thud; it's chunky and low in acidity, which yields a 
thick flavor set of prune and coffee. Better once it breathes, but it's 
still a bit too sticky and syrupy for our liking.</td><td>Reserva</td><td>85</td><td>20</td><td>Mendoza Province</td><td>Mendoza</td><td></td><td>Malbec</td><td>Bodega Norton</td></tr><tr class=""><td>119041</td><td>Argentina</td><td>The
 ÛÏoakÛ in the name is appropriate because this one is draped in 
unctuous, heavy, burnt aromas. The nose is a cloud of coconut, char and 
woody blackberry, while the syrupy palate is all sweet black plum, 
carob, mint and resin. Quite oaky and thick for a value-priced wine.</td><td>Vika Oak</td><td>83</td><td>12</td><td>Other</td><td>San Juan</td><td></td><td>Malbec</td><td>Bodegas La Guarda</td></tr><tr class=""><td>132683</td><td>Argentina</td><td>Jammy
 red-fruit aromas mixed with buttery oak make for a simple, sappy nose. 
There's more butter on the palate in addition to solid blackberry 
flavors. It finishes round but short, with yet another wave of barrel. A
 very good wine but not one that wows.</td><td>Reserva</td><td>87</td><td>18</td><td>Mendoza Province</td><td>LujÌÁn de Cuyo</td><td></td><td>Malbec</td><td>Bodega Norton</td></tr><tr class=""><td>44070</td><td>Argentina</td><td>Rubbery
 and warm on the nose, with earthy plum and blackberry aromas. The 
palate is full and bouncy, with appropriate plum, berry and cassis 
flavors. Nice for standard New World Cab, with fig, chocolate and no 
buttery, sloppy oak.</td><td></td><td>86</td><td>10</td><td>Mendoza Province</td><td>Mendoza</td><td></td><td>Cabernet Sauvignon</td><td>Bodega Norton</td></tr><tr class=""><td>129117</td><td>Argentina</td><td>Colorful
 but low in pulse, with jammy, pasty aromas sitting in front of a bulky,
 one-dimensional palate that offers standard blackberry fruit and mildly
 herbal side flavors. Has just enough acidity to keep it pumping, but as
 a whole it comes across a little too heavy and jammy compared to 
previous years.</td><td>A Lisa</td><td>85</td><td>25</td><td>Other</td><td>RÌ_o Negro Valley</td><td></td><td>Malbec</td><td>Bodega NoemÌ_a de Patagonia</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container" style="width: 310px;"><div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;"><a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a><span>•</span><a href="https://platform.stratascratch.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></div></div></footer></div><script type="text/javascript" src="winemag_files/runtimeapp.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="winemag_files/app.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="winemag_files/styles.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="winemag_files/app_002.js"></script><div class="ReactModalPortal"></div><iframe name="__privateStripeMetricsController8550" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" allow="payment *" src="winemag_files/m-outer-08a1fefa46cfc8cc94fc477ddcdb0555.html" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" style="border: medium none !important; margin: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; width: 1px !important; min-width: 100% !important; overflow: hidden !important; display: block !important; visibility: hidden !important; position: fixed !important; height: 1px !important; pointer-events: none !important; user-select: none !important;" frameborder="0"></iframe></body></html>
